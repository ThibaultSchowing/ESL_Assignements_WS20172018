\section*{Problem 2}

Show that regression splines of degree d with K knots form a vector space of dimension d + K + 1 by providing a balance of the degrees of freedom in every region of the input data range and the lost degrees of freedom due to the smoothness constraints at the knots. Do not use bases of the spline vector space for your argument.
