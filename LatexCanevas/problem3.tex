The difference between LDA and QDA is that in QDA, the response variables are still drawn from a Normal distribution but each class has its own covariance matrix. Thus, the posterior probability $ Pr(Y = k | X = x) $ abbreviated $ p_k(x) $ below, cannot be reduced. (4.11 ISLR )

\[ p_k (x) = \frac{\pi_k \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_k}exp({-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2_k (x - \mu_k)^2}})}{\sum_{l=1}^{k}\pi_l \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}exp({-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2_k (x - \mu_l)^2}})} \]

The denominator here is still constant. It is a sum over all the classes. So, we have to maximize the numerator. We will here consider the log of the numerator and thus we have:

\[ \delta_k (x) = log\left({\pi_k \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_k}exp\left({-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2_k (x - \mu_k)^2}}\right)}\right) \]

We expand the $exp()$ content and separate the log and get:

\[ \delta_k (x) = log(\pi_k) - log(\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_k) - \frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2_k} - \frac{\mu^2_k}{2\sigma^2_k} + \frac{x\mu_k}{2\sigma^2_k} \]
